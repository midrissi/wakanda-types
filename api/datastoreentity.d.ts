	* <details> <summary>**Note** : How to use this method (advanced) : </summary>
	* ***
	* ```
	* Once unloaded by this method, the entity is not unusable. 
	* Wakanda keeps a reference to the entity and automatically reloads it as soon as it becomes used again.
	* This utility method lets you optimize memory consumption when the server needs to load and work with numerous large objects, such as pictures or BLOBs. 
	* 
	* In principle, the garbage collection mechanism of JavaScript will purge unused objects from memory. However, this mechanism operates * * autonomously and can prove to be insufficient in some cases. For example, when the server has loaded dozens of large pictures on the JavaScript side, only references are handled, which may not require the intervention of the garbage collector. 
	* 
	* However, on the server side, the memory is in high demand. In a case like this, it is useful to be able to "force" entities to be unloaded using the release( ) method.
	* 
	* Note that after calling release( ), if you want to make sure that the JavaScript reference to an entity has been deleted without having to wait for garbage collection (and thus for a subsequent access to the entity to return an error), you must force its value to null.
	* ````
	*

	* myEntity.release();   //unload the entity from the server
	* myEntity = null;     // delete its reference

	 * Then you could create a datastore class method
